######The open published interface components and hardware design guide for space-based manufacturing platforms.

###Space-based manufacturing standards.

---Introduction Text :arrow_down:---

######The Space Based Manufacturing Specifications Manual is designed to establish a simple and consistent set of standards for plug-and-play design and code of space-based manufacturing technology.

Each of these aspects contains an assortment of interface descriptions that are open to the community to develop new hardware and software upon. We invite you to read through the interface releases and standards. These interfaces are currently in use by the Made In Space (MIS) Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF). These interfaces are the cornerstone of our plug-and-play technologies, which means that as new technologies are developed by the community they can be infused into current and future space
manufacturing platforms.

As an Open Published format, the contents will be continually evolving. We welcome your support in future iterations. The current release makes available the interface standards for the core aspects for additive manufacturing techniques in space. These include; Materials Handling, Materials Processing, and the Manufacturing Environment.

##How to Use this Document

###For Hardware Desigers

The SBM-Spec enables hardware designers to create new capabilities for existing space-based manufacturing platforms as well as capabilities that conform well to new platforms as they come online. The standardized interfaces in this document may be leveraged by hardware designers to create added value sub-systems to enable a broader ecosystem of manufacturing in space. For consistent design practice, all interface descriptions in this document are presented utilizing the
metric system. Various standards documents are referenced in sub-sections of this document when they pertain specifically to given interfaces. Generally, for any applications of the SBM-Spec where hardware will be utilized in a crewed environment, the hardware designer should reference the NASA Payload Safety Policy and Requirements for the International Space Station, document SSP 51700.

###For Software and Electrical Engineers

The SBM-Spec describes various standard interfaces which consist of an electromechanical aspect. In these situations, the development of software to control given processes may be necessary. In the current release of the SBM-Spec, certain standard electrical connections are defined.

###For Manufacturing Engineers
The SBM-Spec enables manufacturing engineers to build hardware according to a standard design specification. For consistent manufacturing practice, all interface and design descriptions in this document are presented in the metric system. Where appropriate, third-party standards documents are referenced in sub-sections when they pertain specifically to given interfaces. The manufacturing engineer is encouraged to reference these documents when necessary to ensure that new hardware
is built according to the relevant standards. Generally, for any applications of the SBM-Spec where hardware will be utilized in a crewed environment, the manufacturing engineer should reference the NASA Payload Safety Policy and Requirements for the International Space Station, document SSP 51700.
